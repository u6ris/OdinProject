        <h1>Peanut stew</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Protein of your choice, I usually use either beef blocks made specially for stew or chicken; as I only cook for myself, i tend to separate the protein I buy in packages so that whenever I cook, it lasts me two or three servings but you'll often realize that most african recipes use the principle of guesstimation so I'd advise you to start guesstimating to your heart's content by asking yourself questions like : How many times do I want to eat this ? or How many pieces would I eat per serving ?</li>
                <li>Peanut paste</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Bay leaves</li>
                <li>Optional
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chili</li>
                        <li>Tomato Paste</li>
                        <li>Bouillon cube</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash your protein and place it on the stove in a saucepan on medium-high heat with your vegetables, add enough water so that said water reaches half of the protein. This is the precooking step that'll help make our protein tender.<br> When I work with beef, I just add a pinch of salt to the saucepan (more than that to be honest, just avoid hypertension), with chicken I also add my marinade (you can find it here !) made from parsley, garlic and green onions.</li>
                <li>After all the water has evaporated from the saucepan, you can now remove and grind the vegetables in your food processor. With only the protein left in the saucepan, you can add just a smidge of oil and grill your protein on all sides.</li>
                <li>When the flavorful aroma of grilled meat has started to permeate your five-squared meters you call a living-room if you forgot to turn on the kitchen hood (bonus points if you live in a studio apartment meaning you will be able to reminisce that smell in Morpheus' embrace !), you can add back the vegetables mixture to the pan, add water into the processor to get all the bits left and also put that in the pan. According to my mother, if you're cooking with chicken, you can remove it for the moment and put it back near the end of the preparation otherwise it'd break apart in the sauce. So now we wait for the tomato sauce to cook.</li>
                <li>In the meanwhile, you can start diluting the peanut paste, I typically use approximately two full tablespoons. The final consistency should remind of you of milk so really liquid-y and thin. </li>
                <li>When all the additional water has evaporated from the tomato sauce, you can add some (one teaspoon) tomato paste for color and season it with the bouillon cube and some salt to your liking. You can now proceed to add the diluted groundnut paste. Mix well.</li>
                <li>After waiting ten minutes, you can now add some water. <br>Remember two or three lines ago when I told you to brush up your guesstimating skills right ? Well you'll now make use of them ! According to the number of times you said you wanted to eat this meal and the approximate quantity you might eat for each serving (I eat mine with rice, but you could also eat it with foutou (plantain fufu) if you're proficient enough, I'm not.), you can guess how much water you need, I'd often add the same volume that I have in the saucepan at this moment of the preparation and some more. Stir well.</li>
                <li>You can now wait some fifteen minutes and add back the chicken if you used that protein and remove it.</li>
                <li>The stew is ready to be eaten when you're able to see some oil at the surface of the concoction. That usually takes anywhere from thirty minutes to hours so I'd urge to plan and not to start when you're hungry and inches away from death by starvation (I never do that.). As mentionned, you can now eat the stew, but a "traditional" groundnut stew would have a thicker consistency meaning you'd need to leave it cooking more, check the consistency by ten minutes increments and if you're satisfied with it you're good to go !</li>
                <li>Enjoy !</li>
